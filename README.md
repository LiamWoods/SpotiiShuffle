# SpotiiShuffle
Better spotify shuffler for large playlists, and perhaps for small playlists too!

## What is SpotiiShuffle?
SpotiiShuffle is a better way of shuffling your playlists, because as a known bug with spotify their application only allows shuffling of about 50/60 songs, and it gets repetitive. 

It's pretty straight forward and i've tried to make this as dynamic as possible. Thanks for using SpotiiShuffle and PLEASE report issues in the github issues section so I can improve my application.
